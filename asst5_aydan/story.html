              <h2>Ms. America pageant</h2>
              <p>
                “I was seventeen. Only child, not a lot of friends. But I had a
                plan. I was going to become an actress, get a role on All My
                Children, meet my husband on set– and when that was all over,
                I’d host a talk show. Kelly Ripa did it; I could do it too. Back
                then it seemed like every woman on television had gotten their
                start as beauty queen. So my senior year I decided to enter my
                school’s Homecoming Queen competition. It was organized like a
                Ms. America pageant. But this was a rough high school, only one
                other girl signed up, so I had a good shot. My whole family got
                behind me. My mom was a seamstress. We noticed that in most
                pageants we watched, the winner wore a white dress. So she sewed
                me a white dress that I picked out of Seventeen Magazine. First
                came the interview portion, and that’s when the trouble started.
                The judges asked me about the Anita Hill testimony; I wasn’t
                ready for that. I was ready for world peace.
              </p>
              <p>
                They were supposed to ask me about my goals, so I could say
                world peace. But that didn’t happen. The talent portion was
                later that night at the homecoming dance. The whole school was
                there. I chose a Sheena Easton song; poor choice. Not the right
                crowd for that. The other girl chose ‘I Feel Good’ by Stephanie
                Mills, and she had the whole crowd singing along. That’s when I
                knew it was over. But then, a miracle. The guidance counselor
                quieted everyone down, and announced the winner: it was me. Me!
                It was my Kelly Kapowski moment. Everyone was cheering, the
                other girl congratulated me.
              </p>
              <p>
                But it only lasted five seconds, because the guidance counselor
                said: ‘Wait a second, I’m sorry. Joanna is the runner-up.’ It
                was the worst moment of my life. In fact, the only thing that
                got me through COVID was knowing that it could not possibly,
                possibly be worse than that moment. And here’s a twist for you.
                Remember that guidance counselor? Several years later I ended up
                acting alongside his son in a play at Queens College. In one
                scene I pulled a gun on him, and the director was like: ‘We need
                more anger. Think about something that makes you angry.’ I was
                like: ‘Well, that’s easy. His father ruined my senior year. And
                quite possibly, my entire life.”
